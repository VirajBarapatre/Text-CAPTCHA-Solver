# Text-CAPTCHA-Solver
A deep learning-based text CAPTCHA solver using TensorFlow and Python. This project automates CAPTCHA recognition by generating, preprocessing, training, and testing a neural network model to solve text-based CAPTCHAs efficiently.

Text CAPTCHA Solver üîçü§ñ
This project demonstrates how to solve text-based CAPTCHAs using deep learning with TensorFlow and Python. The goal is to create a neural network model that can recognize and solve CAPTCHA images, focusing on accuracy and efficiency.

Features ‚ú®
CAPTCHA Generation: Automatically generates synthetic CAPTCHA images with random text.
Dataset Preparation: Prepares and labels the dataset for training.
Model Training: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a CAPTCHA solver.
Evaluation & Testing: Tests model accuracy and evaluates its performance on CAPTCHA solving.
Prerequisites üì¶
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Pillow)
You can install the dependencies using:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup & Usage üõ†Ô∏è
1. CAPTCHA Dataset Generation
Generate synthetic CAPTCHA images using generate_captcha.py. This will create a dataset of images containing random text.

python generate_captcha.py --num_images 1000 --image_size (200, 50)
2. Preprocess Data
Prepare and preprocess the generated images for training, including resizing and labeling them.


python preprocess_data.py
3. Model Training
Train the CAPTCHA solver model with the preprocessed data.

python train_model.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
4. Evaluate the Model
Test the trained model's performance on new CAPTCHA images.

python evaluate_model.py
Model Architecture üß†
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to recognize the characters in the CAPTCHA images. It uses:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
Dense layers for classification of characters
Example Usage üöÄ
Here‚Äôs how you can generate and solve a CAPTCHA:

Generate a new CAPTCHA image:
python generate_captcha.py --num_images 1
Use the trained model to predict the text:

python solve_captcha.py --image_path 'generated_captcha.png'
Results üìä
The model is evaluated based on accuracy and the ability to solve CAPTCHAs in real-time.
You can test the model on custom CAPTCHA images or integrate it into larger systems for automated CAPTCHA solving.
